My background involves a lot of analytical thinking and calculations for complex tasks, as well as many repetitive tasks. Over the years, I have made small programs in Excel to help me automate these tasks. That is how the idea to start learning programming was born in 2021.
Furthermore, I have always been interested in technology, so I started learning Java as a backend language.
